# PIBKC: Analysis and report for the May 2025 CPT Meeting

This is a repository for the analysis and report for the Pribilof Islands blue king crab (PIBKC) stock to be presented at the May 2025 North Pacific Fishery Management Council's (NPFMC) Crab Plan Team (CPT) meeting and the June 2025 meeting of the NPFMC's Science and Statistical Committee (SSC). This analysis and report do not represent the final 2025 Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation report for the NPFMC. Rather, they present work-in-progress and alternatives for the final assessment, which will be presented to the CPT in September and the SSC in October.
